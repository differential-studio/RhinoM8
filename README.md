# RhinoM8 ü¶è

RhinoM8 is an AI-powered plugin for Rhino 8 that helps you create 3D models through natural language prompts and image uploads. It converts your text descriptions into Python scripts and 3D models.

üëâ [Download RhinoM8](https://differential.fillout.com/t/rRV6AbGw1hus)

## Software Requirements

### Required Software
- Rhino 8 for Windows (Mac version not supported)
- Windows 10 or later
- .NET Framework 4.8 or later
- Python for Rhino (included with Rhino 8)

### System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- RAM: 8GB minimum (16GB recommended)
- Internet connection required for AI services

### API Keys Required
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4)
- Anthropic API key (for Claude)
- X.AI API key (for Grok)
- Meshy API key (for 3D generation)

## Features üöÄ

- **Text-to-3D**: Generate 3D models from text descriptions using Meshy.ai
- **Image-to-3D**: Convert images into detailed 3D models using Meshy.ai
- **Text-to-Code** (Experimental): Convert text descriptions into executable RhinoScript Python code
- **Multi-Model Support** for code generation:
  - OpenAI
  - Anthropic Claude
  - Grok xAI

## How It Works üîß

1. Choose your generation type (Text-to-3D, Image-to-3D, or Text-to-Code)
2. For Text-to-3D: Describe what you want to create in plain English
3. For Image-to-3D: Upload an image of an object you want to convert to 3D
4. For Text-to-Code (Experimental): Describe the geometry you want to create
5. The AI generates your content:
   - 3D models are imported automatically
   - Code is executed directly in Rhino

## Installation üîå

1. Download the latest release
2. Install the .rhp file in Rhino 8
3. Type `RhinoM8` in Rhino to start the plugin
4. Configure your API keys in the settings

## API Keys üîë

You'll need API keys for the services you want to use:
- [Meshy.ai API key](www.meshy.ai?via=differential) (for Text-to-3D and Image-to-3D models)
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (for code generation)
- [Anthropic Claude API key](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys) (for code generation)
- [Grok API key](https://x.ai/api) (for code generation)

## Usage Examples üí°

Text-to-3D Generation:
```
"A detailed architectural column with Corinthian capital"
```

Image-to-3D Generation:
```
Upload any image of a 3D object to convert it into a detailed 3D model
(Works best with simple objects, but can handle complex scenes. Works best with consistent lighting and a plain background.)
```

Text-to-Code Generation (Experimental, works only for simple geometries):
```
"Create a fractal tree" or "Populate a surface with random spheres"
```

## File Locations üìÅ

RhinoM8 stores its files in the following locations:

### Main Directory
`%AppData%\RhinoM8\`

### Components
- **3D Models**: `%AppData%\RhinoM8\Models\`
  - Generated .glb files
  - Thumbnails: `thumbnails` subfolder
  - Textures: `[modelname]_textures` subfolders

- **Settings & History**: Stored in Rhino plugin settings

## Development üõ†Ô∏è

Built with:
- .NET 7.0/4.8
- RhinoCommon SDK
- Windows Forms
- Newtonsoft.Json
